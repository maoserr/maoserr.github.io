## Quick Summary
I'm a slow and methodical developer who is interested in building helpful things for my own life.

## Experience

I work as a full stack data scientist for almost 10 years and am well experienced in the data science stack:
- Spark/Databricks ETL in pyspark & scala
- Tensorflow, Pytorch for general deep learning
- SK Learn for general ML
- XGBoost for tree based models
- Lifelines (Survival analysis) for inventory related models
- CNN based models for image classification/object detection
- Transformer based models for text classification
- Classical bag of word based modeling
- LLM prompt engineering
- Airflow for orchestration
- MLFlow & W&B for model lifecycle management
- Ray for distributed computation
- Docker, terraform for deployment
- Angular for frontend
- Swift/Ionic for iOS
- Kotlin/Ionic for Android
- AWS API Gateway, Route 53, Sagemaker for cloud computing
- etc...

Doesn't really matter the target runtime, I can figure out a suitable stack.

I have developed personal programs in:
- Utility programs for health - See [Redshiftgui](https://github.com/maoserr/redshiftgui). C based desktop app.
- Web scraping extension for reading - See [Epublifier](https://github.com/maoserr/epublifier). Typescript base browser extension.
- Music frontend for source separation - See [Music-util](https://github.com/maoserr/music-util). Python based script.
- Games in unity - To be released...

## Interests

### Programming

I'm always developing something fun for myself. I've done frontend, backend, local apps, mobile apps.

Technology wise I'm not too interested in abstract concepts or theoretical studies (I do enough of that at work). Building useful things is more my jam.

### Reading

I enjoy reading books and articles regularly and am part of multiple book clubs.

I read articles on programming, development, business related often found on:
 - Hacker News - especially news
 - Indiedev
 - Product hunt

I also enjoy books on a various topics:
 - Psychology/sociology of human relationships
 - Business related books, analysis on successful businesses
 - Web novel, Chinese wuxia/xianxia, Japanese Light novels

### Music

I've played violin for around 15 years, since I was 7??? however, I plateaued somehwere around Sibelius and have since started trying various other activities:

- Bamboo flutes (Dizi, Xiao, Bansuri?, Pan flutes)
- Guitar
- Playing around with a DAW.

I hope to one day make some nice sounding music, regardless of the method.
